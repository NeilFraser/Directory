# Directory

This is a free and open source employee directory for small and medium companies.  Out of the box it supports the following data:

* Employee details:
  * Name, email, phone, job title
  * Biography
  * Birth day and month (not year)
  * Start date
  * Active/inactive status
  * List of skills
  * List of languages
  * List of offices
  * Photographs

* Office details:
  * Name, address
  * Latitude and Longitude
  * Photographs

The directory runs as CGI scripts using Python, meaning it can run on any web server on any operating system.  Any SQL database may be used, though it is currently configured for MySQL.
