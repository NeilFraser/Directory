# Directory

This is a free and open source employee directory for small and medium organizations.  Out of the box it supports the following data:

* Employee details:
  * Name, email, phone, job title
  * Biography
  * Birth day and month (not year)
  * Start date
  * Active/inactive status
  * List of skills
  * List of languages
  * List of offices
  * Photographs

* Office details:
  * Name, address
  * Latitude and Longitude
  * Photographs

The directory runs as simple CGI scripts using Python, meaning it can run on any web server on any operating system.  Any SQL database may be used, though it is currently configured for MySQL.  The client-side is pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript, with no frameworks or dependencies.  Browsing access can either be public or private, and editing can be open (e.g. a company-wide wiki) or restricted.

This product was designed and built in Switzerland for New Voice.  Feel free to take this directory and modify it to fit your organization.  If you require assistance with customization or integration, contact root@neil.fraser.name for a quote.
